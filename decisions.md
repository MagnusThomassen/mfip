# MFIP — Architectural Decisions Log

This file records non-trivial architectural decisions made during the design and build of MFIP. Both the chat-based Claude (architect) and Claude Code (builder) reference this file to stay aligned. Add a new entry whenever a decision is made that affects more than one component or contradicts/refines the original design docs.

## 2026-05-07 — Storage layer: local filesystem + Git, not SharePoint

**Decision:** MFIP will use local Windows filesystem (`C:\MFIP\`) as the primary file store, with Git/GitHub for code and prompt versioning. No SharePoint or OneDrive for Business integration.

**Reasoning:** Magnus does not have access to a personal SharePoint and cannot connect workplace or university SharePoint to the project. Personal Microsoft 365 was considered (~£60/year) but rejected as unnecessary cost for v1. Local + Git is sufficient for a single-user system, gives full control, and Power Automate Desktop handles local folder watching natively.

**Implication:**
- Power Automate uses Desktop flows for file watching (Bloomberg inbox, log archive triggers).
- Cloud flows still used for Teams notifications, Outlook digest, RSS aggregation.
- DuckDB live file stays local; nightly JSON exports committed to Git for point-in-time recovery.
- Excel models versioned via date-stamped folders, optionally Git-LFS later if history matters.
- External backup (e.g. weekly copy to external drive or personal OneDrive) recommended but not part of MFIP runtime architecture.

**Affected docs:** `01_ARCHITECTURE.docx`, `03_TECH_STACK.docx`, `04_BUILD_SEQUENCE.docx` — all updated 2026-05-07.

**Revisit trigger:** If Magnus moves to multi-user access or requires remote access from non-Windows devices, reconsider personal M365 + SharePoint.
